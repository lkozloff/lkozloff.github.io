              <h3><a href="http://asianhope.org">Asian Hope</a> <small>August 2009 - Present: Phnom Penh, Cambodia</small></h3>
          <p>Asian Hope is an international nonprofit dedicated to improving the lives of vulnerable children in Cambodia through education.</p>
          <p>As the Management of Information Systems (MIS) Director, I partner with our top executives to transform our nonprofit into an enterprise class organization. At this level I have leveraged enterprise-wide information to re-engineer IT infrastructure and team strategy across locations and continents, bringing both into efficient alignment with our key priorities. </p>
              <p>Some notable accomplishments:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>founded and grew the MIS department to efficiently serve the IT infrastructure, technical support, training and policy needs of Asian Hope</li>
                  <li>planned the growth, infrastructure and budgets as Asian Hope grew from serving 30 staff at one location to 800 staff and students at 6 locations</li>
                  <li>transitioned the organization to operate on a "free software first" philosophy, which saved 5% of our total annual operating budget, and allowed us to mentor partner organizations making similar changes</li>
		  <li>orchestrated a cross-department effort to gather requirements for a custom monitoring and evaluation system. As the product owner I oversaw all technical decisions, developed the data model, roadmap and wrote the majority of the code.</li>
		  <li>deployed and wrote tooling around student information systems (SIS) as well as developed a thorough training program for our staff. The usage of these systems has saved >50,000 employee hours in the 7 years since deployment</li>
		  <li>planned and wrote software for large parts of Asian Hope's Employee Management system, which lets our HR staff manage student and employee details using an intuitive AngularJS-based UI.</li>
		  <li>deployed Google Apps domains for the organization and schools, including sync to our LDAP server for thousands of users</li>
		  <li>deployed JIRA and Confluence and trained staff across departments for the purposes of internal documentation and trouble ticketing</li>
              </ul>
