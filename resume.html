              <p>Graduated 2005 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering</p>
              <h2>Spoken Language Proficiency</h2>
              <h3>English <small>native speaker</small></h3>
              <p>I'm very comfortable in English, although the longer I've been out of the US I'm wondering if my grammar hasn't suffered!</p>
              <br/>
              <h3>ភាសាខ្មែរ (Khmer/Cambodian) <small>Studied 2009-present</small></h3>
              <p>I can read, write and type Khmer script slowly. In speaking, I'm comfortable in everyday situations but find it difficult to grasp complex topics.</p>
              <br/>
              <h3>日本語 (Japanese) <small>Studied 2000,2007-2009</small></h3>
              <p>I can read, write and type basic Japanese, and know approximately 500 kanji. In speaking, I'm comfortable in most situations, and can carry on conversations on a variety of topics. Nearly all of my interactions with my coworkers were in Japanese while I was in the JET Programme.</p>

              <p>I can read French, but my spelling is so bad I wouldn't say I can write it. As a Peace Corps Volunteer nearly all of my interactions were in French, from basic life tasks and training others in technical topics.</p>
              <br/>
              <h3>Español (Spanish) <small>Studied 1995-2000</small></h3>
